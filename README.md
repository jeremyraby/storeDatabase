# About

This project is part of the [Intro to SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) course on Khan Academy. The objective is to create a store database including 1 table with 5 fields and then display the table sorted by price. At least one summary statistic is also asked to be displayed. The original project can be found on my Khan Academy [profile](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_338609594343258875070801/projects).
