# About

This project is part of the [Intro to SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) course on Khan Academy. The objective is to create a store database including 1 table with 5 fields and then display the table sorted by price. At least one summary statistic is also asked to be displayed. The original project can be found on my Khan Academy [profile](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_338609594343258875070801/projects).

## What I Learned

This project was the first full project I've done using SQL and helped me practice creating tables as well as selecting fields to be displayed. I also figured out how to chain together `SELECT` statements to display summary statistics as a single row.

## Shout Out

I used [Derek Landy's](https://twitter.com/dereklandy) book series [*Skulduggery Pleasant*](https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=skulduggery+pleasant&search_type=books&search%5Bfield%5D=on) for the products in this project. If you haven't heard of them, and you're at all into YA or fantasy books, check them out!
